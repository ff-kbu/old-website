			<p>Our Freifunk (for free radio) network enables regional communication – independent of commercial interests.</p>
			<p>Freifunk KBU connects people interested in free radio networks from Cologne, Bonn, and the surrounding regions. We are a branch of the global Freifunk community.</p>
			<p>Freifunk is more than cheap network access for everyone. Social and political aspects are also important. The Freifunk community is part of a global movement creating free and open infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Our vision is to make communication channels more democratic by using free networks. Freifunk communities around the world this idea by providing the necessary infrastructure. See
