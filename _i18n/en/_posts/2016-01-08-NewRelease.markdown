Hi folks,

last week on thursday (in the very early morning) we've got the news that a new firmware release was prepared by the h@ckers among us.

Along with bugfixes and adjustments the new release implements the region split of the actual KBU network into "Hoods". The raise of nodes in the network necessitate this step. We think that in that way the network will grow much more smoothly. Thatswhy we recommend you to upgrade your nodes or using only the new release for setting up new nodes.

With the new firmware the nodes will perform meshing only in the respective Hood, what (hopefully) will give us more bandwith in the global network.

For users who upgraded their routers always to the gluon-software release the new firmware can be downloaded [HERE](https://jenkins.kbu.freifunk.net/files/kbu-gluon-release/v1.4/), Thiese files are also capable for routers with the classic firmware, if you have no need to keep your setup options. 

If you are using the classic firmware and like to keep your options, use [THESE FILES](https://jenkins.kbu.freifunk.net/files/kbu-gluon-release/classicupgrade/v1.4/).

If you have any questions or wishes, try to find a solution in the wiki and don't hesitate to contact us through the mailing list.

Regards, MoNeo
